## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

```
- Docker
```
Please ensure you have Docker installed, running with Linux containers.

### Installing

The food permit service is dependant on MobileFoodPermits.Service.csproj.

To run a successful containerized version of the FoodPermit service, open the root directory where the docker-compose.yml resides. Open a terminal and run the below command

```
docker-compose up --build
```

if this command had already been run previously and you do not require a rebuild simply run the commmand

```
docker-compose up
```

### Run with own data file

The default data file is stored in data/Mobile_Food_Permit_Map.csv. If you want to use own file, you will need to store the file in the data folder and update the FileSettings:FileName in src\MobileFoodPermits.Service\appsettings.json file with your file name. 

Note: If you want to reference any file that is not stored in data folder, you need to update the volumes in docker-compose.yml.
